# Arduino-Based Robotic Arm

This project was completed as part of my university coursework. I built and
programmed a basic robotic arm using Arduino and servo motors to better
understand hardware control, electronics, and simple automation concepts.
The system was programmed using Arduino IDE to perform basic arm movements.

## Features
- Basic robotic arm movement using servo motors
- Manual control logic implemented in Arduino
- Simple automation for arm positioning

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino microcontroller
- Servo motors
- Basic electronics

## Project Documentation
The project report and presentation include the full explanation of the system
design and screenshots of the Arduino code, as submitted for the course.
